# PyFly - Python Fixed Wing Flight Simulator
PyFly is a python implementation of a 6 DOF aerodynamic model for fixed wing aircraft. PyFly uses
quaternions internally for performance reasons and to avoid singularities, while constraints and initial conditions can be
specified in euler angles for convenience.

PyFly simulates the effects of wind and stochastic turbulence, modeled with the Dryden turbulence model.

A simple PID-controller tuned to the Skywalker X8 UAV is included for convenience and sanity checks.

The base aircraft parameters must be specified through a parameter file. An example of such a file experimentally verified
by wind tunnel testing is included for the Skywalker X8 UAV, courtesy of <https://github.com/krisgry/x8>.

Aerodynamic coefficients in PyFly contain nonlinear extensions in angle of attack and sideslip angle, designed with 
Newtonian flat-plate-theory, in an effort to extend model-validity in the state space and incorporate effects such as stall:

## Example

```python
from pyfly import PyFly
from pid_controller import PIDController

sim = PyFly("pyfly_config.json", "x8_param.mat")
sim.seed(0)

sim.reset(state={"roll": -0.5, "pitch": 0})

pid = PIDController(sim.dt)
pid.set_reference(0.2, -0.1, 22)

for step_i in range(500):
    phi = sim.state["roll"].value
    theta = sim.state["pitch"].value
    Va = sim.state["Va"].value
    omega = [sim.state["omega_p"].value, sim.state["omega_q"].value, sim.state["omega_r"].value]

    action = sim.get_action(phi, theta, Va, omega)
    # Simulator expects [elevator, aileron, rudder, throttle] while PID is adapted to X8 which lacks rudder.
    action = [action[0], action[1], 0, action[2]]  
    success = sim.step(action)

    if not success:
        break

sim.render(block=True)
```

Rendering this scenario produces:

## Documentation
PyFly is highly configurable through its config json file. All model states must be declared in this file, and be on the
following form:
